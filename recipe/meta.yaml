  summary: Cross platform GUI toolkit for Python, "Phoenix" version
  description: |
    Welcome to wxPython's Project Phoenix! Phoenix is the improved next-generation
    wxPython, "better, stronger, faster than he was before." This new
    implementation is focused on improving speed, maintainability and
    extensibility. Just like "Classic" wxPython, Phoenix wraps the wxWidgets C++
    toolkit and provides access to the user interface portions of the wxWidgets
    API, enabling Python applications to have a native GUI on Windows, Macs or
    Unix systems, with a native look and feel and requiring very little (if any)
    platform specific code.
